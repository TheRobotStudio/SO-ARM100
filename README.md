# SO-ARM-100
Standard Open Arm 100 - Early alpha for testing prints and sizings.

Video instructions are on the @therobotstudio YouTube channel, there's a playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy7gxZH9jzfR0l8fYH8C1nyEc4pxSBrer

The arm is intended for integration with the open source "Le Robot" system being developed by the community at Hugging Face.

Six STS3215 servos are needed to actuate the five dof in the arm and the gripper.

At quantities of 1000 units even the higher power 12v version of the STS3215 servos used in all the joints of the present arm design are under 12 USD each - exworks - so around 15 USD in your hand.

Plus an adaptor board to connect to a computer and a clamp to fix it the desk.

If 167 (1000/6 = 166.6666) people are all prepared to buy the servos at once, and assuming that everything else is 3d printed, that's a 5DOF arm with gripper (6 dof total) and a half kilo payload for 100 bucks.
