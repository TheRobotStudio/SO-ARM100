## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing an **Overhead Camera** on the SO-100 robot using a **Web Camera** and a 3D-printed **Arm Base** and **Camera Mount**.

## Camera Design Aims

1. Create camera data usable as model input, independently or with wrist camera footage
2. Provide overhead view of entire manipulation space
3. Support both single follower arm and double follower ("bi-manual") arm setups
4. Ensure consistent data across SO-100 arm users through standardized camera positioning



## Required Components
- **Web Camera** (1) - this is the [recommended model](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082X91MPP)
- **3D-printed parts**
    - [Arm Base](stl/arm_base.stl) (1 per follower arm)
    - [Camera Mount Bottom](stl/cam_mount_bottom.stl) (1)
    - [Camera Mount Top](stl/cam_mount_top.stl) (1)
- **M2 Screws** (8) - these are the smaller screws that came with your Feetech servos.

## Assembly Instructions
### Step 1: Remove the existing base from the *webcam*

On the webcam, go to the joint where the base is attached.  
1. Remove the soft plastic cover from the joint.
2. Unscrew/remove the screw in the joint.
3. You should now be able to remove the base from the camera module.




### Step 2: Attach the *webcam* onto the *camera mount top*

1. Push the *webcam* into the *camera mount top* by aligning the round joint holes.
2. Screw *M2* screws into the 2 round holes on either side of the *camera mount top* round joint.
### Step 3: Attach the *camera mount top* to the *camera mount bottom*.

1. Push the *camera mount top* into the *camera mount bottom* by aligning the linear joint lines on the bottom of *camera mount top* with the top of the *camera mount bottom*.
2. Screw an *M2* screw into each of the 4 holes in the linear joint.
### Step 4: Attach the *arm base* to the *camera mount bottom*.

1. Push the *arm base* into the joint lines on the side of the *camera mount bottom*.  (Do twice if you have 2 follower arms.)
### Step 5: Attach the *SO-100 follower arm* to the *arm base*.
<img height="250" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24b4c0ce-e62b-4fd6-963c-09448e7ae6f9" /></br>
1. Align the bottom of the SO-100 follower arm with the top of the *arm base*. (Do twice if you have 2 follower arms.)
   
### Step 6: Configure Software 
1. In your software, add your overhead cam, including setting its resolution and FPS. 
- **Note**: You will likely want to set your resolution to *640 x 480* and FPS to *30* even if the camera module's max resolution/frame rate is higher or wider, as most models work with lower resolutions and any higher will just be data bloat.  This camera mount was specifically designed for 640 x 480 resolution and width.
2. Look at the video feed from your newly installed camera (On Mac, you can also use *QuickTime*->*New Movie Recording* to see this feed).  You should be able to see the workspace of the arm(s).
