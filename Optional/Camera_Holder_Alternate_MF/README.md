## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing a **Wrist Camera** (alternate "McGartoll-Fung" design) on the SO100 robot using a **Camera Module** and a 3D-printed **Jaw Replacement Part**.

## Comparison to Main Design
#### Advantages:
- smaller
- fewer parts

#### Disdvantages:
- requires removal/replacement of existing **Moving Jaw** vs an add-on

## Required Components
### Hardware:
- **USB Camera Module** (1) - this is the [recommended model](https://www.amazon.com/innomaker-Computer-Raspberry-Support-Windows/dp/B0CNCSFQC1/ref=pd_lpo_d_sccl_3/132-7372155-9780230?pd_rd_w=eYz4L&content-id=amzn1.sym.4c8c52db-06f8-4e42-8e56-912796f2ea6c&pf_rd_p=4c8c52db-06f8-4e42-8e56-912796f2ea6c&pf_rd_r=XC3EXZRSSXKDB1G0Z5D7&pd_rd_wg=1wTpn&pd_rd_r=932b1976-9ac7-4cef-9774-f0f9c3acb804&pd_rd_i=B0CNCSFQC1&psc=1), but any 32mm x 32mm USB camera module with min 720p / 30 fps spec will likely work
- [3D-printed Moving Jaw Replacement](stl/Camera_Holder_Alternate_MF.stl) (1)
- **M3 Screws** (4) - these are the smaller screws that came with your Feetech servos.

## Assembly Instructions
### Step 1: Replace the old Jaw with the new one
1. If a [Moving Jaw](../../stl_files_for_3dprinting/Individual/Follower/Print_Follower_SO_ARM100_08k_UP_Prusa%20-%20Moving_Jaw_08d-1.STL) is already installed on the arm, detach it by:
 - unscrewing all 8 **M3 Screws** from the front and back servo motor horns 
 - gently pulling the part out
2. 3D print the **Moving Jaw Replacement**.

3. Attach the **Moving Jaw Replacement** by doing the reverse of (1).


### Step 2: Install the Camera
1. Take out the **Camera Module**.
2. Align the 4 holes of the **Camera Module** with the **Moving Jaw Replacement**, and attach using 4 **M3 Screws**.

### Step 3: Configure Software and Adjust Focus
1. In your software, set your resolution and FPS. 
- **Note**: You will likely want to set your resolution to *640 x 480* and FPS to *30* even if the camera module's max resolution/frame rate is higher, as most models work with lower resolutions and any higher will just be data bloat.
2. Turn on your arm.  Look at the video feed from your newly installed camera (On Mac, you can also use *QuickTime*->*New Movie Recording* to see this feed).  Adjust the focus by twisting the lens counterclockwise or clockwise until the video feed is clear.
